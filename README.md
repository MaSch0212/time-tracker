## 🐱‍🏍 Getting Started

Just download and extract the ZIP file from the [latest release](https://github.com/MaSch0212/time-tracker/releases/latest) to some folder and start the `TimeTracker.exe`.<br>
There are currently two different versions available:
- net5.0-windows: Built for .NET 5.0 which is the newest version of .NET and the way forward for this project.<br>
- net48: Built for .NET Framework 4.8 which is installed by default in Windows 10 1903 and newer versions of Windows.<br>
  This version is useful if you can not install .NET 5.0 due to missing administrative privileges.

Currently both versions have the same feature set, though this might change in the future. If you can install .NET 5.0 it is recommended to use that version instead of .NET Framework.

The newest version of the .NET 5.0 Desktop Runtime can be found here: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0/runtime
